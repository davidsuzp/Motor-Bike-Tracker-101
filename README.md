# Motor-Bike-Tracker-101
Repo for a personal project to implement a Motorcycle/Bike Tracker, based on Arduino 101, main features, writing to a SD Card, calculate inclinations, velocity and positioning.

The structure of this project it's based on the electronics, development and finally the enclosures with the stl files.
I hope you enjoy during the construction.

The design and implementation it's based an incremental techniques, so, will be very easy to incorporate different parts and features.

BOM:
    * Arduino Genuino 101 https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-101-619 (Retired :( )
    * LCD 20 X 4 with PCF8574T
    
A.- Code and integration of Arduino Genuino 101 and components
    1.- Starting with the IMU
        The Arduino 101, contains internally a IMU (TODO: Include a reference on Arduino WEBsite)
        TODO: comments related to the calculus, several questions appears on this point
        
    2.- Adding a LCD 20X4
        The first approach was with LCD 20X4, including Libraries (I'm trying to recover the original source, for mentioning purposes, but not found the original) due I remembered changes over the original to function propertly.
    
    3.- 
B.- 3D Printing 

At this moment the repo it's under construction, but all the codes and 3d Files to print are ready to use, but not published yet.
