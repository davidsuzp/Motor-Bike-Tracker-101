# Motor-Bike-Tracker-101
Repo for a personal project to implement a Motorcycle/Bike Tracker, based on Arduino 101, main features, writing to a SD Card, calculate inclinations, velocity and positioning.

The structure of this project it's based on the electronics, development and finally the enclosures with the stl files.
I hope you enjoy during the construction.

The design and implementation it's based an incremental techniques, so, will be very easy to incorporate different parts and features.

1.- Starting with the IMU
    The Arduino 101, contains internally a IMU (TODO: Include a reference on Arduino WEBsite)
    TODO: comments related to the calculus, several questions appears on this point
    
2.- Adding a LCD 20X4
    The first approach was with LCD 20X4, including Libraries (I'm trying to recover the original source, for mentioning purposes, but not found the original) due I remembered changes over the original to function propertly.
    
At this moment the repo it's under construction, but all the codes and 3d Files to print are ready to use, but not published yet.
