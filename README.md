# Motor-Bike-Tracker-101
Repo for a personal project to implement a Motorcycle/Bike Tracker, based on Arduino 101, main features, writing to a SD Card, calculate inclinations, velocity and positioning.

The structure of this project it's based on the electronics, development and finally the enclosures with the stl files.
I hope you enjoy during the construction.

The design and implementation it's based an incremental technich, so, will be very easy to incorporate different parts and features.

At this moment the repo it's under construction, but all the codes and 3d Files to print are ready to use, but not published yet.
